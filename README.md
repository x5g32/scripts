# scripts

Hello, I'm Chris. Programming has been my hobby for many years now, mostly in web development. I'm most familiar with PHP, and some SQL, JQuery, and AJAX mixed in too. I would like to learn more and improve my programming skills, and hopefully explore new careers!
I will use this repository to share my own little project scripts. Thanks for reading!
